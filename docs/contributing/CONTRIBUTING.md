guidelines below in order to submit your contributions for review:

### High impact or architectural changes

Reach out to us on [Telegram](https://t.me/POKTnetwork) and start a discussion with the team regarding your change
before you start working. Communication is key for open source projects and asynchronous contributions.

### Coding style

- Code must adhere to the official Go formatting guidelines (i.e. uses [gofmt](https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt)).
- (Optional) Use [Editor Config](https://editorconfig.org) to help your Text Editor keep the same formatting used
  throughout the project.
- Code must be documented adhering to the official Go commentary guidelines.
- Pull requests need to be based on and opened against the `main` branch.

### Criteria for PR Evaluation

- Quality: the PR should include instructions on how to test the submitted code. Automated tests are not a must in all
  situations, but always strongly encouraged
- Criteria expressed in [this document](TASTE.md)
- Context: make it easy for the reviewers to understand what is being addressed by the PR and why it's important to the
  project
