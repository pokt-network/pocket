# How to contribute?

We have an [extensive contribution guide](docs/contributing/CONTRIBUTING.md) outlining all the steps to contribute, but if you just want to start getting involved, follow the next two steps:

1. Look at available work on [app.dework.xyz/pokt-network](https://app.dework.xyz/pokt-network) or look at our [starter tasks](https://github.com/pokt-network/pocket/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22starter+task%22) / [community](https://github.com/pokt-network/pocket/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22community%22+) tasks on Github.

2. Leave a comment on a Github issue, PR or connect with someone from the core team to earn a contributor batch on Discord.

3. Collaborate with the team and other core contributors on Discord in the [#v1-dev channel](https://discord.com/channels/553741558869131266/986789914379186226) or [#v1-research channel](https://discord.com/channels/553741558869131266/936666517498650644).

_Note that you'll still need to familiarize yourself with the details of the [contribution guide](docs/contributing/CONTRIBUTING.md) over time but get involved first!_
