## LFG - Development

### Install Dependencies

- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- Install [Golang](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- Install [protoc-gen-go](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go)

### Prepare Local Environment

Generate local files

```bash
$ make protogen_clean
$ make protogen_local
$ go mod vendor && go mod tidy
$ make mockgen
```

### View Available Commands

```bash
$ make
```

### Running LocalNet

![V1 Localnet Demo](./v1_localnet.gif)

Delete any previous docker state

```bash
$ make docker_wipe
```

In one shell, run:

```bash
$ make compose_and_watch
```

In another shell, run:

```bash
$ make client_start
$ make client_connect

> ResetToGenesis
> PrintNodeState # Check committed height is 0
> TriggerNextView
> PrintNodeState # Check committed height is 1
> TriggerNextView
> PrintNodeState # Check committed height is 2
> TogglePacemakerMode # Check that it’s automatic now
> TriggerNextView # Let it rip!
```

### Running Tests

```bash
$ make test_all
```
