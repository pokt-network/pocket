## üèÅ Where to Start?

This is a general set of steps we have found to help new core team members onboard to Protocol development.

1. Watch our [2022 Infracon presentation on v1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJoZyzQuJVc) to get a general idea of how everything works. _(43 mins)_

   - This will help you understand the core building components of a Pocket V1 Node

2. Run a **LocalNet** by following the [development guide](https://github.com/pokt-network/pocket/blob/main/docs/development/README.md). _(1-2 hours)_

   - This will get you set up to start contributing
   - Reach out to the core team in the [#v1-dev](https://discord.com/channels/553741558869131266/986789914379186226) discord channel if you hit any issues
   - _TIP: Once you clone the Github repo, you can `cd pocket` and run `make` from to see all the available commands._

3. Get an understanding of the the V1 spec summaries by reading about the [4 modules in our docs](https://docs.pokt.network/home/learn/future). _(3-5 hours)_

   - This will get you understand the spec foundations for Pocket V1

4. **Optional**: If you‚Äôre interested, you can view the [_OG v0 Pocket whitepaper_](https://pocket-network-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/pdfs/Pocket-Network-Whitepaper-v0.3.0.pdf). _(10-12 hours)_

   - This can provide both valuable and interesting historical context into Pocket

5. Over time, **and not all at once**, you can start making your way through and updating the [V1 specifications](https://github.com/pokt-network/pocket-network-protocol). _(30 hours)_

   - Mastering these concepts won't be easy but will make you an expert on Pocket V1
   - _TIP: We hope to publish it with V1 benchmarks on arxiv one day, so this is your change to contribute üôÇ_
   - **Optional**: If you're a core team member or heavily involved in the project, reach out to the team about getting access to the V1 specification research documents.

   -->

6. Start getting acquainted with the code structure by looking at the [docs on the shared architecture](https://github.com/pokt-network/pocket/tree/main/shared). _(1 hour)_

   - This will help you understand the code architecture of Pocket V1

7. View our [V1 Roadmap](https://github.com/pokt-network/pocket/blob/main/docs/roadmap/README.md). _(10 mins)_

   - This will give you insight into our development & release timelines

8. Get a sense of all the open issues and tickets [in out Github project](https://github.com/orgs/pokt-network/projects/142/views/12). _(1 hour)_
9. If you don't already have a starter task, pick one from [Dework](https://app.dework.xyz/pokt-network), our [open issues](https://github.com/pokt-network/pocket/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc) or ask the team in the [#v1-dev](https://discord.com/channels/553741558869131266/986789914379186226) discord channel. _(1 hour)_

10. Jump on a call and pair code! _(‚àû and beyond)_

- If you need a walk-through of the code and some pointers before getting started, **jump on a call!**
- If you need to take your time to understand the problem and the code first, do so, and then **jump on a call!**
- If you don't need help, **when you‚Äôre about 33% of the way done**, show your draft work and get some feedback, so **jump on a call!**
- Just leave a message in the [#v1-dev](https://discord.com/channels/553741558869131266/986789914379186226) discord channel and someone from the core team will respond.

## ‚ùå Non-suggested reads

The papers in this list were read by our team and would not be recommended to become more productive to contributing to Pocket.

We do not consider them bad, but time is limited so it is important to focus on what will bring the most learning value.

- [Blockchains Meet Distributed Hash Tables: Decoupling Validation from State Storage](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01935)
  - An "extended abstract" of how Authenticated Data Structures (i.e. Merkle Trees) could be _"sharded"_ across nodes using Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) to reduce the state required to be maintained and synched by each node.
