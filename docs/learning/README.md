# Learning Pocket

_This is a live document on how to get ramped up on all the knowledge you need to contribute to the Pocket Protocol._

## Where to Start?

This is a general set of steps we have found to help new core team members onboard to Protocol development.

1.  Watch our [2022 Infracon presentation on v1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJoZyzQuJVc) to get a general idea of how everything works.
2.  Run a LocalNet by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/pokt-network/pocket/blob/main/docs/development/README.md).

    **Pro tip**: Did you know there are a bunch of `make` commands? Run `make` from the root repo to see whatâ€™s available.

3.  Get an understanding of the the V1 spec summaries by reading about the 4 modules [here](https://docs.pokt.network/home/learn/future).
4.  If youâ€™re interested in the _OG v0 Pocket whitepaper_, check out [this link](https://pocket-network-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/pdfs/Pocket-Network-Whitepaper-v0.3.0.pdf).
5.  Over time, **and not all at once**, you can start making your way through and updating the V1 specs: https://github.com/pokt-network/pocket-network-protocol.

    **Tip**: We hope to publish it with V1 benchmarks on arxiv one day, so this is your change to contribute ðŸ™‚

    -->

6.  To start getting acquainted with the code, look at the [README on the shared architecture](https://github.com/pokt-network/pocket/tree/main/shared).

7.  Want to get a sense of all the open issues and tickets? [Check out this page](https://github.com/orgs/pokt-network/projects/142/views/12) or ask for a starter task in the [#v1-dev](https://discord.com/channels/553741558869131266/986789914379186226) discord channel if you donâ€™t have one.

8.  Jump on a call and pair code!

- If you need a walk-through of the code and some pointers before getting started, **jump on a call!**
- If you need to take your time to understand the problem and the code first, do so, and then **jump on a call!**
- If you don't need help, **when youâ€™re about 33% of the way done**, show your draft work and get some feedback, so **jump on a call!**
- Just leave a message in the [#v1-dev](https://discord.com/channels/553741558869131266/986789914379186226) discord channel and someone from the core team will respond.
