### Feedback and Open Discussion üí°

[Feedback and Discussion Form](https://app.sli.do/event/eF13JYg93rGq4pGLRnHLF5)

Q: Do we have a distributed tracing framework for collecting metrics?

A: The logging module is being productionized so that it can be integrated with observability tooling like Prometheus. There currently is no distributed tracing of requests between protocol actors. Once the applied logging module has been merged (https://github.com/pokt-network/pocket/pull/420), distributed tracing (https://github.com/pokt-network/pocket/issues/143) can begin development.
