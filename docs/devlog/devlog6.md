## Feedback and Open Discussion 💡

### Q: I saw that Milestones are past due so when I attach issues or PRs I receive notifications. Is this expected? How can I stop receiving these notifications?

A: Roadmap timelines need to be updated per Q1 results and Q2 planning. Check [here](https://github.com/pokt-network/pocket/blob/main/docs/roadmap/README.md#m1-pocket-pos-proof-of-stake) for the latest updates!
