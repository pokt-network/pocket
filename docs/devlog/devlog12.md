### V0

We have prepared the [release plan](https://www.notion.so/pocketnetwork/RC-0-10-4-Release-Plan-848c0c329e554a78a2aaf05bcaafb763?pvs=4) for `RC 0.10.4` with the helpful of everyone in the community!

### V1

Our goal, for the second iteration in a row, was **to finalize demos** as much as possible from the [previous iteration](https://github.com/pokt-network/pocket/blob/main/docs/devlog/devlog11.md).

üü°üü¢ Like last week, we made progress on two more demos and give ourselves an overall score of `7/10` as we are tying together lots of lose ends.

#### Utility - E2E Trustless Relay Demo
