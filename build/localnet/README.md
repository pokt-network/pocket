## TLDR

If you feel adventurous, and you know what you're doing, here is a rapid guide to start LocalNet:

1. Install Docker
2. Install Kind (e.g., `brew install kind`)
3. Create Kind cluster (e.g., `kind create cluster`)
4. Start LocalNet (e.g., `make localnet_up`)

Otherwise, please continue with the full guide.

## Dependencies

All necessary dependencies, except Docker and Kubernetes cluster, are installed automatically when running `make install_cli_deps`. The following dependencies are required for LocalNet to function:

1. [tilt](https://docs.tilt.dev/install.html)
2. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) or [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
3. `Kubernetes cluster`: refer to [Choosing Kubernetes Distribution](#choosing-kubernetes-distribution) section for more details.
4. `kubectl`: CLI is required and should be configured to access the cluster. This should happen automatically if using Docker Desktop, Rancher Desktop, k3s, k3d, minikube, etc.
5. [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install): required to template the YAML manifests for the dependencies (e.g., Postgres, Grafana). Installation instructions available.

### Choosing Kubernetes Distribution

While [any Kubernetes distribution](https://docs.tilt.dev/choosing_clusters.html) should work, we've had success and recommend to use [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation). To run Kind Kubernetes clusters, you need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed.

#### How to create Kind Kubernetes cluster

Kind depends solely on Docker. To install Kind, follow [this page](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation).

Create a new cluster:

```bash
kind create cluster
```

Make sure your Kubernetes context is pointed to new kind cluster:

```bash
kubectl config current-context
```

should return `kind-kind`. Now you can start LocalNet!

## LocalNet

### Starting LocalNet

```bash
make localnet_up
```

This action will create a file called `localnet_config.yaml` in the root of the repo if it doesn't exist. The default configuration can be found in [Tiltfile](Tiltfile#L11).

### Viewing Logs

The developer can then view logs either from a browser or terminal.

### Terminal Logs

- `make localnet_logs_validators` - shows prior logs
- `make localnet_logs_validators_follow` - shows prior logs and follows the new log lines as validators do their work

### Tilt Web UI Logs

- Pressing `space` in terminal where you started `tilt`
- Go to [localhost:10350](http://localhost:10350/)

### Scaling Actors

When starting a k8s LocalNet, `localnet_config.yaml` is generated (with default configs) in the root of the repo if doesn't already exist.

The config file can be modified to scale the number of actors up/down. As long as `localnet_up` is running, the changes should be automatically applied within seconds.

[Watch demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4950477/216490690-8ac4c16a-25e1-4202-b2e5-03215030c82c.mp4)

### Stopping & Clean Resources

```bash
make localnet_down
```

The command stops LocalNet and cleans up all the resources, including the postgres database.

### Interacting w/ LocalNet

As the workloads run in Kubernetes, you can see and modify any resources on your local kubernetes by a tool of your choice (k9s, Lens, VSCode extension, etc), but note that Tilt will change manifests back eventually.

#### Make Targets

Open a shell in the pod that has `client` cli available. It gets updated automatically whenever the code changes:

```bash
make localnet_shell
```

Open a `client debug` cli. It allows to interact with blockchain, e.g. change pace maker mode, reset to genesis, etc. It gets updated automatically whenever the code changes (though you would need to stop/start the binary to execute the new code):

```bash
make localnet_client_debug
```

### Addresses and keys on LocalNet

You can find private keys and addresses for all actors in the [private-keys.yaml](./manifests/private-keys.yaml) file. They have been pre-generated and follow a specific pattern – they start with pre-determined numbers for easier troubleshooting and debugging.

Addresses begin with `YYYXX` number, where `YYY` is a number of an actor and `XX` is [a type of actor](../../shared/core/types/proto/actor.proto#L7).

The current mapping for `XX` is:

- `01` - Application
- `02` - Servicer
- `03` - Fisherman
- `04` - Validator

For example:

- `420043b854e78f2d5f03895bba9ef16972913320` is a validator #420.
- `66603bc4082281b7de23001ffd237da62c66a839` is a fisherperson #666.
- `0010297b55fc9278e4be4f1bcfe52bf9bd0443f8` is a servicer #001.
- `314019dbb7faf8390c1f0cf4976ef1215c90b7e4` is an application #314.

## How to change configuration files

Configurations can be changed in helm charts where network protocol actor configs are maintained. You can find them in [this directory](../../charts).

`config.json` file is created using the `config` section content in `values.yaml`. For example, you can find the configuration for a validator [here](../../charts/pocket/values.yaml#70).

If you need to add a new parameter – feel free to modify the section in place. Some of the parameters that contain secrets (e.g. private key), are stored in Secrets object and injected as environment variables.

Please refer to helm charts documentation for more details.

## How does it work?

[tilt](https://tilt.dev/) reads the [`Tiltfile`](./Tiltfile), where LocalNet configs are specified. `Tiltfile` is written in [Starlark](https://github.com/bazelbuild/starlark), a dialect of Python.

The k8s manifests that `tilt` submits to the cluster can be found in [this directory](./). Please refer to [code structure](#code-structure) for more details where different parts are located.

Tilt continuously monitors files on local filesystem in [specific directories](Tiltfile#L27), and it rebuilds the binary and distributes it to the pods on every code change. This allows developers to iterate on the code and see the changes immediately (i.e. hot-reloading).

## Troubleshooting

### Why?

Developers might experience issues with running LocalNet on Kubernetes.

Issues might be related to the fact different developers run different clusters/OS/environments.

Machines going to sleep and that might not play well with virtual machines, postgres or pocket client.

### Force Trigger an Update

Visit the tilt web UI by pressing `space` in the shell where you started tilt or by visiting [this webpage](http://localhost:10350/).

If you see any errors, you can click `Trigger Update` on a resource that has issues to restart the service or retry a command.

### Force Restart

If force triggering an update didn't work, try the following:

1. `make localnet_down`
2. `make localnet_up`

### Full Cleanup

If a force restart didn't help, try rebuilding local kubernetes cluster using the tool you're managing your cluster with (e.g. Docker Desktop, Rancher Desktop, k3s, k3d, minikube, etc).
