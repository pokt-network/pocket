- Updated manifests and K8S resources to reflect the new `cluster-manager` addition
- In K8S LocalNet, the `cli-client` now waits for `v1-validator001` since its required for address book sourcing

## [0.0.0.3] - 2023-01-11

- Reorder private keys so addresses (retrieved by transforming private keys) to reflect the numbering in LocalNet appropriately. The address for val1, based on config1, will have the lexicographically first address. This makes debugging easier.

## [0.0.0.1] - 2022-12-29

- Updated all `config*.json` files with the missing `max_mempool_count` value
- Added `is_client_only` to `config1.json` so Viper knows it can be overridden. The config override is done in the Makefile's `client_connect` target. Setting this can be avoided if we merge the changes in https://github.com/pokt-network/pocket/compare/main...issue/cli-viper-environment-vars-fix

## [0.0.0.0] - 2022-12-22
