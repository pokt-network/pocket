# Iteration 3 Demo

## Setup LocalNet (shell 1)

```bash
m̶a̶k̶e̶ ̶d̶o̶c̶k̶e̶r̶_̶w̶i̶p̶e̶ # Clear everything; takes a long time
make # show all the commands
make docker_wipe_nodes # clear all 4 validator nodes
make db_drop # clear the existing database
make compose_and_watch # Start 4 node LocalNet environment
```

## Setup LocalNet debugger (shell 2)

```bash
make client_start && make client_connect # start the debugger

...
PrintNodeState
...
TriggerNextView
...

```

## Inspect the data in the database (shell 3)

Connect to the DB:

```bash
make db_show_schemas # show 4 nodes
make db_cli_node # connect to the default node 1
```

Query the DB:

```bash
show search_path;
select height, hash from block;
select * from account;
select * from pool;
```

## Inspect the data in the database in another node (shell 4)

```bash
psqlSchema=node3 make db_cli_node # connect to node 3
```

Query the DB:

```bash
show search_path;
select height, hash from block;
select * from account;
select * from pool;
```

## Trigger command via client (shell 5)

```bash
go run app/client/*.go # show all the commands

go run app/client/*.go --path_to_private_key_file=/Users/olshansky/workspace/pocket/pocket/build/pkeys/val1.json Account Send 6f66574e1f50f0ef72dff748c3f11b9e0e89d32a 67eb3f0a50ae459fecf666be0e93176e92441317 1000

go run app/client/*.go --path_to_private_key_file=/Users/olshansky/workspace/pocket/pocket/build/pkeys/val2.json Account Send 67eb3f0a50ae459fecf666be0e93176e92441317 6f66574e1f50f0ef72dff748c3f11b9e0e89d32a 1000
```

## Swagger UI (shell 6)

```bash
make swagger-ui
```

##

## What is this doing?

- 4 Validators
- HotPOKT
- RainTree
- Sending POKT
- Using CLI
- Validating Transaction
- Generating State Hash
- Reading state from DB

## What corners did we cut for this demo?

**A lot.**

Persistence - state hash implementation & design

- Not merged to main
- May have big changes incoming as a result of state sync

CLI

- the source for the private key

Keybase

- Not implemented yet (hardcoded in the configs & genesis)

Infra

- K8s operator not merged to main yet
- Not used in this demo

Trust vs proof

- Tooling to prove to you (user/audience) that integrity is maintained DNE yet
- Still heavily dependent on trust that things work
  - Requires more tooling
  - Requires more testing
