### [#235](https://github.com/pokt-network/pocket/pull/235) Config and genesis handling

- Abstracted config and genesis handling
- Mockable runtime
- Refactored all modules to use `RuntimeMgr`
- Updated `RuntimeMgr` to manage clock as well
- Modules now accept `interfaces` instead of paths.
- Unmarshalling is done in a new `runtime` package (runtime because what we do in there affects the runtime of the application)
- We are now able to accept configuration via environment variables (thanks to @okdas for inspiration and [sp13 for Viper]("github.com/spf13/viper"))
