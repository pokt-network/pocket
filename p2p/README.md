# P2P Module

This document is meant to be a supplement to the living specification of [1.0 Pocket's P2P Specification](https://github.com/pokt-network/pocket-network-protocol/tree/main/p2p) primarily focused on the implementation, and additional details related to the design of the codebase and information related to development.

## Interface

This module aims to implement the interface specified in `pocket/shared/modules/p2p_module.go` using the specification above.

## Implementation

### Code Architecture - Network Module

_DISCUSS(team): If you feel this needs a diagram, please reach out to the team for additional details._
_TODO(olshansky, BenVan): Link to RainTree visualizations once it is complete._

The `Network Module` is where RainTree (or the simpler basic approach) is implemented. See `raintree/network.go` for the specific implementation of RainTree, but please refer to the specifications for more details.

## Testing

### Testing Suite

The core utilities used for RainTree unit testing live in `raintree_utils_test.go`.

In addition, a lot of RainTree-related helpers (finding the target, etc...) live in `addrbook_utils_test.go`.

### Unit Tests

```bash
$ make test_p2p           # All P2P tests
$ make test_p2p_addrbook  # AddrBook tests
```

### Benchmarking Tests

```bash
$ make benchmark_p2p_addrbook  # AddrBook benchmark
```

### DevNet

Pocket's development LocalNet uses RainTree by default, see `docs/development/README.md` on how to run it.
