// instances of a submodule to be dependency-injectable.
//
// CONSIDERATION: this is inconsistent with existing submodule "name" naming
// conventions as the "name" doesn't match the name of the interface. This is
// implied by the fact above, as two distinct "names" are needed to disambiguate
// in the module registry. These names are also distinct from the names of the
// respective `Router` implementations; our reasoning is that these names better
// reflect the separation of concerns from the P2P module's perspective.
