- Fixed typo in 'peers_manager.go'

## [0.0.0.10] - 2022-12-14

- mempool cap is now configurable via P2PConfig. Tests implement the mock accordingly.
- Introduced the concept of a `addrbookProvider` that abstracts the fetching and the mapping from `Actor` to `NetworkPeer`
- Temporary hack to allow access to the `addrBook` to the debug client (will be removed in an upcoming PR already in the works for issues [#203](https://github.com/pokt-network/pocket/issues/203) and [#331](https://github.com/pokt-network/pocket/issues/331))
- Transport related functions are now in the `transport` package

## [0.0.0.8] - 2022-11-14

- Removed topic from messaging

## [0.0.0.7] - 2022-10-24

### [#235](https://github.com/pokt-network/pocket/pull/235) Config and genesis handling

- Updated to use `RuntimeMgr`
- Updated tests and mocks
- Removed some cross-module dependencies

## [0.0.0.4] - 2022-10-06

## [0.0.0.3] - 2022-09-15

**[TECHDEBT] AddrBook management optimization and refactoring** [#246](github.com/pokt-network/pocket/issues/246)

- Added `peersManager` and `target` in order to abstract away and eliminate redundant computations
- Refactored debug logging in `getTarget` to print first and second target on the same line
- Refactored `AddPeerToAddrBook` to use an event-driven approach in order to leverage sorted data structures
- Added `RemovePeerToAddrBook` making use of the same pattern
- Improved performance of `AddPeerToAddrBook` and `RemovePeerToAddrBook` by making the implementations O(n)
- Updated `stdnetwork` to use a map instead of a slice

## [0.0.0.2] - 2022-08-25

**Encapsulate structures previously in shared [#163](github.com/pokt-network/pocket/issues/163)**

- Ensured proto structures implement shared interfaces
- `P2PConfig` uses shared interfaces in order to accept `MockP2PConfig` in `test_artifacts`
- Moved connection_type to bool for simplicity (need to figure out how to do Enums without sharing the structure)

## [0.0.0.1] - 2022-07-26
