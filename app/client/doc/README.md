# CLI

The CLI is meant to be an user but also a machine friendly way for interacting with Pocket Network.

The spirit of the documentation is to continuously update and inform the reader of the general scope of the node binary as breaking, rapid development occurs.

There are two modes of operating the CLI. Standard and Debug. Standard is the default mode and is meant for users to interact with the network. Debug is meant for developers to interact with the network and debug issues. To enter debug mode, the CLI must be built with the `debug` build tag.
