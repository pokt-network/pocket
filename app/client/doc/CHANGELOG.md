## [0.0.0.5] - 2023-02-02

- Create `Keybase` interface to handle CRUD operations for `KeyPairs` with a `BadgerDB` backend
- Add logic to create, import, export, list, delete and update (passphrase) key pairs
- Add logic to sign and verify arbitrary messages
- Add unit tests for the keybase

## [0.0.0.4] - 2023-01-10

- The `client` (i.e. CLI) no longer instantiates a `P2P` module along with a bus of optional modules. Instead, it instantiates a `client-only` `P2P` module that is disconnected from consensus and persistence. Interactions with the persistence & consensus layer happen via RPC.
- Replaced previous implementation, reliant on `ValidatorMap`, with a temporary fetch from genesis. This will be replaced with a lightweight peer discovery mechanism in #416
