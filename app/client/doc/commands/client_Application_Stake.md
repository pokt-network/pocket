## client Application Stake

Stake a Application in the network. Custodial stake uses the same address as operator/output for rewards/return of staked funds.

### Synopsis

Stake the Application into the network, making it available for service.

Will prompt the user for the *fromAddr* account passphrase. If the Application is already staked, this transaction acts as an *update* transaction.

A Application can update relayChainIDs, serviceURI, and raise the stake amount with this transaction.

If the Application is currently staked at X and you submit an update with new stake Y. Only Y-X will be subtracted from an account.

If no changes are desired for the parameter, just enter the current param value just as before.

```
client Application Stake <fromAddr> <amount> <relayChainIDs> <serviceURI> [flags]
```
