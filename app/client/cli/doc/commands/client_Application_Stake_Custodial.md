## client Application Stake Custodial

Stake a node in the network. Custodial stake uses the same address as operator/output for rewards/return of staked funds.

### Synopsis

Stake the node into the network, making it available for service.
Will prompt the user for the <fromAddr> account passphrase. If the node is already staked, this transaction acts as an *update* transaction.
A node can update relayChainIDs, serviceURI, and raise the stake amount with this transaction.
If the node is currently staked at X and you submit an update with new stake Y. Only Y-X will be subtracted from an account
If no changes are desired for the parameter, just enter the current param value just as before.
