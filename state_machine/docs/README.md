## Overview

The `StateMachine` module implements a FSM (Finite State Machine) that is responsible for managing the node lifecycle since its internal behaviour can be different depending on certain conditions that are used to determine the current state.

In a nutshell: The FSM guarantees that the node is always in one specific state and verifies state transition (i.e. edges) to/from valid states (i.e. vertices).

## High Level Architecture

High-level implementation details:

- The [github.com/looplab/fsm](https://github.com/looplab/fsm) library is used to implement the FSM
- Pocket builds a wrapper around `looplab/fsm` to integrate with the other modules
- The `StateMachineModule` can be accessed via the `bus` from any other `IntegratableModule`
- State machine transitions emit `StateMachineTransitionEvent` events that subscribed pocket modules can listen to
- The `node` has a central [event handler](../../shared/node.go) for events that fan-out event handling to the relevant modules during state transitions

### FSM primer

The FSM has a declarative definition of an initial state and a set of transitions that have an `Event`, `Source` states and a single `Destination` state.

These are the main building blocks:

- **Event**: An event is a string that represents an action that can trigger a transition. For example, the event `start` can be used to trigger a transition from the `stopped` state to the `starting` state.
- **State**: A state is a string that represents a state that the FSM can be in. For example, the state `stopped` can be used to represent a state where the node is not running.
- **Callback**: A callback is a function that is called when a transition occurs. For example, a callback can be used to log the transition or to perform some other action. Various types of callbacks essentially drive behaviour **WHEN** they are called and help build more complex behaviours like transition cancelling, etc. See the core FSM library documentation for more details.

## State Machine States, Events and Lifecycle

### Startup

- **Initialization**: A node always starts in the `Stopped` state. Once it `Start`s, it transitions to `P2P_Bootstrapping`.
- **P2P Bootstrapping**: The P2P module handles `P2P_Bootstrapping` -> fills the peer address book -> triggers a `P2P_IsBootstrapped` event -> transitions to `P2P_Bootstrapped`.

### Consensus

- **P2P_Bootstrapped**: The Consensus module handles `P2P_Bootstrapped` -> triggers a `Consensus_IsUnsynced` event -> transitions to `Consensus_Unsynced`.
- **Consensus_Unsynced**: Node is out of sync, the Consensus module sends `Consensus_IsSyncing` event -> transitions to `Consensus_SyncMode` to start syncing with the rest of the network.
- **Consensus_SyncMode**: The Consensus module runs `Start()` and requests blocks one by one from peers in its address book.
- **Node finishes syncing**: When node completes syncing:
  - if the node is a validator, the Consensus module sends `Consensus_IsSyncedValidator` event -> transitions to `Consensus_Pacemaker`.
  - if the node is not a validator, the Consensus module sends `Consensus_IsSyncedNonValidator` event -> transitions to `Consensus_Synced`.
- **Consensus_Pacemaker**: Node participates in the block generation process. If node receives a block proposal with height higher than its current height, the Consensus Module sends `Consensus_IsUnsynced` event -> transitions to `Consensus_Unsynced`.
- **Consensus_Synced**: Currently, the Consensus module never sends `Consensus_IsSyncedValidator` event, and non-validator node always stays in `Consensus_SyncMode`.

A diagram of the current state machine definition can be found [here](state-machine.diagram.md).

_NOTE:_ If you make changes to the state machine by changing states, events, or state transitions, you can re-generate the state machine diagram via:

```bash
make generate_node_state_machine_diagram
```
