### Consensus - Core

- Force consensus to use a "star-like" broadcast instead of "RainTree" broadcast
- Improve logging throughout through the use of emojis and rewording certain statements
- Slightly improve the block verification flow (renaming, minor fixes, etcâ€¦) to stabilize LocalNet

### Consensus - Tests

- Rename the `consensus_tests` package to `e2e_tests`
- Internalize configuration related to `fail_on_extra_msgs` from the `Makefile` to the `consensus` module
- Forced all tests to fail if we receive extra unexpected messages and modify tests appropriately
- After #198, we made tests deterministic but there was a hidden bug that modified how the test utility functions because the clock would not move while we were waiting for messages. This prevented logs from streaming, tests from failing, and other issues. Tend to all related changes.

- Pass a `reason` to `InterruptRound`
- Improve readability of some parts of the code

## [0.0.0.13] - 2022-12-14

- Consolidated number of validators in tests in a single constant: `numValidators`
- Fixed typo in `make test_consensus_concurrent_tests` so that we can run the correct test matrix
- Using `GetBus()` instead of `bus` wherever possible
