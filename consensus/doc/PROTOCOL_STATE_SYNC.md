# State Sync Protocol Design <!-- omit in toc -->

⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES TO THE (last updated on 08/03/2023):

- TECHDEBT(#821): Once the FSM is remove, state sync will look completely different
- State Sync implementation is a WIP and has taken several different shapes.
- This document is out of date and needs to be updated to reflect the latest implementation. This will be done once a functional implementation is in place.
- This document makes some assumption of P2P implementation details, so please see [p2p](../../p2p/README.md) for the latest source of truth.

## Background

State Sync is a protocol within a `Pocket` node that enables the download and maintenance of the latest world state. This protocol enables network actors to participate in network activities (like _Consensus_ or _Web3 Provisioning & Access_) in present time, by ensuring the synchronization of the individual node with the collective network.

## State Sync - Peer Metadata

A node participating in the `State Sync` protocol can act as both a _server_ and/or a _client_ to its `Network Peers`. A pre-requisite of the State Sync protocol is for the `P2P` module to maintain an active set of network peers, along with metadata corresponding to the persistence data they have available.

Illustrative example of Peer Metadata functions related to State Sync (not a production interface):

```golang
type PeerSyncMetadata interface {
  // ...
  GetPeerID() string   // An ID (e.g. a derivative of a PublicKey) associated with the Peer
  GetMinHeight() int64 // The minimum height the peer has in the BlockStore
  GetMaxHeight() int64 // The maximum height the peer has in its BlockStore
  // ...
}
```

## State Sync - Peer Metadata Collection

Peer metadata can be collected through the `P2P` module during the `Churn Management Protocol`. It can also be abstracted to an `ask-response` cycle where the node continuously asks this metadata information to its active peers.

Node gathers peer metadata from its peers in `StateSyncMetadataResponse` type, defined as the following:

```golang
type StateSyncMetadataResponse struct {
  PeerAddress string
  MinHeight   uint64
  MaxHeight   uint64
}
```

Node periodically requests peer metadata from active peers after starting, as a background process. The following is an illustrative example:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber

    actor N as Node
    participant NP as Network Peer(s)

    loop periodic sync
        N->>+NP: Are you alive? If so, what's your Peer Metadata?
        NP->>N: Yup, here's my Peer Metadata. What's yours?
        N->>+N: Add metadata to local buffer
        N->>NP: ACK, here's mine. I'll ask again in a bit to make sure I'm up to date.
    end
```

The aggregation and consumption of this peer-meta information enables the node to understand the global network state through sampling Peer Metadata in its local peer list. The Node aggregates the collected peer metadata to identify the `MaxHeight` and `MinHeight` in the global state.

This gives a view into the data availability layer, with details of what data can be consumed from peer via:

```golang
type StateSyncModule interface {
  // ...
  GetAggregatedStateSyncMetadata() *StateSyncMetadataResponse // Aggregated metadata received from peers.
  IsSynced() (bool, error)
  Start() error
  // ...
}
```

Using the aggregated `StateSyncMetadataResponse` returned by `GetAggregatedStateSyncMetadata()`, a node is able to compare its local state against that of the Global Network that is visible to it (i.e. the world state).

### State Sync Lifecycle

The Node bootstraps and collects state sync metadata from the rest of the network periodically, via a background process. This enables nodes to have an up-to-date view of the global state. Through periodic sync, the node collects received `StateSyncMetadataResponse`s in a buffer.

For every new block and block proposal `Validator`s receive:

- node checks block's and block proposal's validity and applies the block to its persistence if its valid.
- if block is higher than node's current height, node checks if it is out of sync via `IsSynced()` function that compares node's local state and the global state by aggregating the collected metada responses.

According to the result of the `IsSynced()` function:

- If the node is out of sync, it runs `Start()` function. Node requests blocks one by one using the minimum and maximum height in aggregated state sync metadata.
- If the node is in sync with its peers it rejects the block and/or block proposal.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    %% start
    A[Node] --> B[Periodic <br> Sync]
    A[Node] --> |New Block| C{IsSynced}

    %% periodic sync
    B --> |Request <br> metadata| D[Peers]
    D[Peers] --> |Collect metadata| B[Periodic <br> Sync]


    %% is node synched
    C -->  |No| E[Start]
    C -->  |Yes| F[Apply Block]

    %% syncing
    E --> |Request Blocks| D[Peers]
    D[Peers] --> |Block| A[Node]

```

## State Sync - Operation Modes

State sync can be viewed as a state machine that transverses various modes the node can be in, including:

1. Unsyched Mode
2. Sync Mode
3. Synced Mode
4. Pacemaker Mode
5. Server Mode

The functionality of the node depends on the mode it is operating it. Note that `Server Mode` is not mutually exclusive to the others.

For illustrative purposes below assume:

- `localSyncState` is an object instance complying with the `PeerSyncMetadata` interface for the local node
- `globalSyncMeta` is an object instance of `StateSyncMetadataResponse` complying with the `StateSyncModule` interface for the global network, which is returned by the `GetAggregatedStateSyncMetadata()` function.

### Unsynced Mode

The Node is in `Unsynced` mode if `localSyncState.MaxHeight < GlobalSyncMeta.Height`.

In `Unsynced` Mode, node transitions to `Sync Mode` by sending `Consensus_IsSyncing` state transition event, to start catching up with the network.

### Sync Mode

In `Sync` Mode, the Node is catching up to the latest block by making `GetBlock` requests, via `Start()` function to eligible peers in its address book. A peer can handle a `GetBlock` request if `PeerSyncMetadata.MinHeight` <= `localSyncState.MaxHeight` <= `PeerSyncMetadata.MaxHeight`.

Though it is unspecified whether or not a Node may make `GetBlock` requests in order or in parallel, the cryptographic restraints of block processing require the Node to call `CommitBlock` sequentially until it is `Synced`.

### Synced Mode

The Node is in `Synced` mode if `localSyncState.Height == globalSyncMeta.MaxHeight`.

In `SyncedMode`, the Node is caught up to the latest block (based on the visible view of the network) and relies on new blocks to be propagated via the P2P network every time the Validators finalize a new block during the consensus lifecycle.

### Pacemaker Mode

The Node is in `Pacemaker` mode if the Node is snyched **and** is an active Validator at the current height.

In `Pacemaker` mode, the Node is actively participating in the HotPOKT lifecycle.

### Server Mode

The Node can serve data to other nodes, upon request, if `ServerMode` is enabled. This sub-protocol runs in parallel to the node's own state sync in order to enable other peers to catch up.

### Operation Modes Lifecycle

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[StateSync] --> B{Caught up?}
    A[StateSync] --> P{ServerMode <br> enabled?}

    %% Is serving peers?
    P --> |Yes| Q[Serve Mode]
    P --> |No| R[Noop]
    Q --> |Serve blocks<br>upon request| Z[Peers]

    %% Is caught up?
    B --> |Yes| C{Is Validator?}
    B --> |No| E[UnsyncedMode]
    E --> |Send | D[SyncMode]

    %% Syncing
    D --> |Request blocks| Z[Peers]

    %% Is a validator?
    C --> |No| F[Synced Mode]
    C --> |Yes| G(Pacemaker Mode<br>*HotPOKT*)
    F --> |Listen for<br>new blocks| Z[Peers]

    %% Loop back
    Z[Peers] --> |Blocks| A[StateSync]
```

_IMPORTANT: `ApplyBlock` is implicit in the diagram above. If any blocks processed result in an invalid `StateHash` during `ApplyBlock`, a new `BlockRequest` must be issued until a valid block is found._

## State Sync Designs

### Block by Block

The block-by-block involves a node requesting a single block from its peers, one at a time, and apply them as they are received. Internal implementation details related to local caching and ordering are omitted from the diagram below.

#### Synchronous

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  actor N as Node
  actor P as Peer(s)

  loop continuous
    N ->> P: Request Metadata
    P ->> N: Metadata
    N ->> N: Update local directory
  end

  loop until caught up
    N ->> P: Request Block
    P ->> N: Block
    N ->> N: ApplyBlock
  end
```

#### Asynchronous

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  actor N as Node
  actor P as Peer(s)

  loop continous
    N -->> P: Send Metadata Request
    P -->> N: Send Metadata Response
    N ->> N: Update local directory
  end

  loop until caught up
    N -->> P: Send Block Request
    P -->> N: Send Block Response
    N ->> N: ApplyBlock
  end
```

### Future Design Work

- `Fast Sync Design` - Sync only the last `N` blocks from a _snapshot_ containing a network state

- `Optimistic Sync Design` - Optimize the State Sync protocol by parallelling requests and computation with pre-fetching and local caching

- `Block Chunk Design` - Update the single block-by-block to be able to receive and provide multiple blocks per request.

- `Block Stream Design` - Update the Block by Block design to stream blocks via a WebSocket from a single connectable peer.

## Research Items

_TODO(M5): Create issues to track and discuss these work items in the future_

- Investigate how does the persistence layer design of `pruning` Merkle Tree affects `StateSync`.
- Investigate how DB Pruning of the `SQL DB` might affect fast sync.
- Investigate how churn management in relation to `RainTree` could provide opportunities or obstacles with StateSync.

## Glossary

- `ApplyingBlock`: The process of transitioning the Node's state by applying the transactions within a block using the Utility module.
- `GetBlock`: A network message one peer can send to another requesting a specific Block from its local store.
- `Churn Management`: A protocol in Pocket's P2P Module that ensures the most updated view of the network peer list is available.
- `Network Peer`: Another node on the network that this node can directly communicate with, without going through a third-party server. Peers may start the connection through an `inbound` or `outbound` initialization to share & transmit data.
- `SyncState`: The state of a network w.r.t to where it is relative to the world state (height, blocks available, etc).

## References

State Sync, also known as Block Sync, is a well researched problem and we referenced various sources in our thinking process.

### Tendermint

**Example:**

Tendermint follow an **async "fire-and-forget"** pattern as can be seen [here](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/blob/main/blocksync/reactor.go#L176):

```go
// respondToPeer loads a block and sends it to the requesting peer,
// if we have it. Otherwise, we'll respond saying we don't have it.
func (bcR *Reactor) respondToPeer(msg *bcproto.BlockRequest,
 src p2p.Peer) (queued bool) {

 block := bcR.store.LoadBlock(msg.Height)
 if block != nil {
  bl, err := block.ToProto()
  if err != nil {
   bcR.Logger.Error("could not convert msg to protobuf", "err", err)
   return false
  }

  return src.TrySend(p2p.Envelope{
   ChannelID: BlocksyncChannel,
   Message:   &bcproto.BlockResponse{Block: bl},
  })
 }

 bcR.Logger.Info("Peer asking for a block we don't have", "src", src, "height", msg.Height)
 return src.TrySend(p2p.Envelope{
  ChannelID: BlocksyncChannel,
  Message:   &bcproto.NoBlockResponse{Height: msg.Height},
 })
}
```

### Celestia

**Example:**

Celestia uses a synchronous request-response pattern as seen [here](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-node/blob/main/header/sync/sync.go#L268).

```go
// PubSub - [from:to]
func (s *Syncer) findHeaders(ctx context.Context, from, to uint64) ([]*header.ExtendedHeader, error) {
 amount := to - from + 1 // + 1 to include 'to' height as well
 if amount > requestSize {
  to, amount = from+requestSize, requestSize
 }

 out := make([]*header.ExtendedHeader, 0, amount)
 for from < to {
  // if we have some range cached - use it
  r, ok := s.pending.FirstRangeWithin(from, to)
  if !ok {
   hs, err := s.exchange.GetRangeByHeight(ctx, from, amount)
   return append(out, hs...), err
  }

  // first, request everything between from and start of the found range
  hs, err := s.exchange.GetRangeByHeight(ctx, from, r.start-from)
  if err != nil {
   return nil, err
  }
  out = append(out, hs...)
  from += uint64(len(hs))

  // then, apply cached range if any
  cached, ln := r.Before(to)
  out = append(out, cached...)
  from += ln
 }

 return out, nil
}
```
