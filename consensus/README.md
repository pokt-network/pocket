## Interface

This module adheres to the interface outlined in `pocket/shared/modules/consensus_module.go`, which is derived from the above specification.

## Consensus Processes

This repository features an implementation of the HotStuff consensus algorithm. It facilitates the consensus process through a series of rounds. Staked validator nodes participate in the consensus process, with one node serving as the leader and the rest as replicas.

### Leader Election

A dedicated submodule handles the leader election process. The current configuration employs a deterministic round-robin leader election mechanism. We are working on a randomized leader election mechanism with cryptographic sortition using Verifiable Random Functions (VRFs), see [Algorand's Whitepaper Section 5.1](https://algorandcom.cdn.prismic.io/algorandcom%2Fa26acb80-b80c-46ff-a1ab-a8121f74f3a3_p51-gilad.pdf) for detailed explanation. Upon its' completion, round-robin leader election will be 

### Consensus Phases

The HotStuff consensus algorithm consists of three phases: `Prepare`, `Pre-Commit`, and `Commit`. It is worth to note that recently published [HotStuff 2 research paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/397.pdf) proposes the updated HotStuff consensus algorithm which only needs two phases. 

In each phase of Hotstuff, the leader creates a proposal and broadcasts it to all replica nodes. 

Upon receiving the proposal, each replica node performs a block validation check. If the proposal is valid, the replica node responds to the leader with its signature as a vote.

When the leader collects votes from more than two-thirds of the replicas, it progresses to the next consensus phase. This two-thirds rule is essential to achieve Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT), ensuring network resilience against faulty or malicious nodes.

### Block Generation

Block generation in the HotStuff consensus algorithm involves a series of interactive steps between the Leader and the Replica nodes. The steps are as follows:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Leader
    participant Replicas
    Note over Leader,Replicas: Leader Election
    Leader->>Replicas: Propose(block)
    Note over Replicas: Validate proposed block
    Replicas-->>Leader: Prepare(block)
    Note over Leader: Receives Prepare messages from a quorum of Replicas
    Leader->>Replicas: Pre-Commit(block, Prepare messages)
    Note over Replicas: Validate Pre-Commit message
    Replicas-->>Leader: Commit(block)
    Note over Leader: Receives Commit messages from a quorum of Replicas
    Leader->>Replicas: Notify(block, Commit messages)
    Note over Replicas: Add block to local blockchain copy
    Note over Leader,Replicas: New Leader Election
```

### Block Validation

Every proposal made by the leader undergo a series of validation steps during the `Prepare` phase, which are carried out by the replicas. However, during the `Pre-commit` and `Commit` phases, the replicas are solely responsible for performing signature validation.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Receive Block proposal from leader]
    B[Perform basic validation]
    C[Check Block structure]
    D[Validate quorum certificate]
    E[Validate optimistic threshold]
    F[Block is Valid - apply block]
    G[Block is Invalid - Reject the proposal]
    H[Create and send vote message to the leader]
    A-->B
    B-->C
    C-->D
    D-->E
    E-->F
    F-->G
    B-.->H
    C-.->H
    D-.->H
    E-.->H
    F-.->H
```

### Consensus Lifecycle

The consensus lifecycle begins with a new round that includes leader election, proposal creation, proposal validation, vote aggregation, and block commitment. The steps are as follows:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[Start New Round] --> |Elect Leader| L[Leader Election Module]
  L --> D1[Leader]
  L --> D2[Replica]
  D1 --> E1[Create Proposals]
  D2 --> E2[Validate Proposals]
  E1 --> F1[Aggregate Votes]
  E2 --> F2[Vote on Proposals]
  F1 --> G1[Quorum and Commit Block]
  F2 --> G2[Commit Block]
  G1 --> J1[End Round]
  G2 --> J1
  J1 --> A
```

### State Sync

State synchronization is crucial to ensure all participating nodes maintain a consistent and up-to-date view of the network state. It is especially important in a dynamic and decentralized network where nodes can join, leave, or experience intermittent connectivity. For an in-depth understanding of the state sync process and its current status, please refer to our [State Sync Protocol Design Specification](https://github.com/pokt-network/pocket/blob/main/consensus/doc/PROTOCOL_STATE_SYNC.md).

```mermaid
graph TB
  A(Start testing)
  A --> Z(Add new validators)
  Z --> B[Trigger Next View]
  
  B --> C{BFT threshold satisfied?}
  C -->|No| E(No new block, height is same)
  E --> B1[Trigger Next View]
  
  C -->|Yes| D(New block, height increases)
  D --> F{Are there new validators staked?}
  F -->|No| J{Are syncing nodes caught up?}

  J --> |No| B2[Trigger Next View]
  J --> |Yes| H[Success, new validators are synced!]
  F -->|Yes| G(Wait for validators' metadata responses)
  G --> B3[Trigger Next View]
  
  subgraph Notes
     note1>NOTE: BFT requires > 2/3 validators<br>in the same round & height, voting for the proposal.]
     note2>NOTE: Syncing validators request blocks from the network.]
