## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.0.12] - 2022-12-15

- Remove `SetProposalBlock` and local vars to keep proposal state
- Add `proposerAddr` to the `Commit` function
- Move the `PostgresContext` struct to `context.db`

## [0.0.0.11] - 2022-12-14

- Moved Actor related getters from `genesis.go` to `actor.go`
- Added `GetAllStakedActors()` that returns all Actors

## [0.0.0.10] - 2022-12-06

## [0.0.0.9] - 2022-11-30

Core StateHash changes

- Introduced & defined for `block_persistence.proto`
  - A persistence specific protobuf for the Block stored in the BlockStore
- On `Commit`, prepare and store a persistence block in the KV Store, SQL Store
- Replace `IndexTransactions` (plural) to `IndexTransaction` (singular)
- Maintaining a list of StateTrees using Celestia’s SMT and badger as the KV store to compute the state hash
- Implemented `ComputeStateHash` to update the global state based on:
  - Validators
  - Applications
  - Servicers
  - Fisherman
  - Accounts
  - Pools
  - Transactions
  - Added a placeholder for `params` and `flags`
- Added a benchmarking and a determinism test suite to validate this

Supporting StateHash changes

- Implemented `GetAccountsUpdated`, `GetPoolsUpdated` and `GetActorsUpdated` functions
- Removed `GetPrevAppHash` and `indexTransactions` functions
- Removed `blockProtoBytes` and `txResults` from the local state and added `quorumCert`
- Consolidate all `resetContext` related operations into a single function
- Implemented `ReleaseWriteContext`
- Implemented ability to `ClearAllState` and `ResetToGenesis` for debugging & testing purposes
- Added unit tests for all of the supporting SQL functions implemented
- Some improvements in unit test preparation & cleanup (limited to this PR's functionality)

KVStore changes

- Renamed `Put` to `Set`
- Embedded `smt.MapStore` in the interface containing `Get`, `Set` and `Delete`
- Implemented `Delete`
- Modified `GetAll` to return both `keys` and `values`
- Turned off badger logging options since it’s noisy

## [0.0.0.8] - 2022-11-15

- Rename `GetBlockHash` to `GetBlockHashAtHeight`
- Reduce visibility scope of `IndexTransactions` to `indexTransactions`
- Remove `quorumCertificate` from the local context state
- Remove `LatestQC` and `SetLatestQC`
- Remove `Latest` prefix from several functions including related to setting context of the proposal block
- Added `ReleaseWriteContext` placeholder
- Replaced `ResetContext` with `Release`

## [0.0.0.7] - 2022-11-01

- Ported over storing blocks and block components to the Persistence module from Consensus and Utility modules
- Encapsulated `TxIndexer` logic to the persistence context only

## [0.0.0.6] - 2022-10-06

- Don't ignore the exit code of `m.Run()` in the unit tests
- Fixed several broken unit tests related to type casting

## [0.0.0.5] - 2022-09-14

- Consolidated `PostgresContext` and `PostgresDb` into a single structure

## [0.0.0.4] - 2022-08-25

**Encapsulate structures previously in shared [#163](github.com/pokt-network/pocket/issues/163)**

- Renamed schema -> types
- Added genesis, config, and unstaking proto files from shared
- Ensured proto structures implement shared interfaces
- Populate `PersistenceGenesisState` uses shared interfaces in order to accept `MockPersistenceGenesisState`
- ^ Same applies for `PersistenceConfig`
- Bumped cleanup TODOs to #149 due to scope size of #163

## [0.0.0.3] - 2022-08-16

**Main persistence module changes:**

- Split `ConnectAndInitializeDatabase` into `connectToDatabase` and `initializeDatabase`
  - This enables creating multiple contexts in parallel without re-initializing the DB connection
- Fix the SQL query used in `SelectActors`, `SelectAccounts` & `SelectPools`
  - Add a generalized unit test for all actors
- Remove `NewPersistenceModule` and an injected `Config` + `Create`
  - This improves isolation a a “injection-like” paradigm for unit testing
- Change `SetupPostgresDocker` to `SetupPostgresDockerPersistenceMod`
  - This enables more “functional” like testing by returning a persistence module and avoiding global testing variables
  - Only return once a connection to the DB has been initialized reducing the likelihood of test race conditions
- Implemented `NewReadContext` with a proper read-only context
- Add `ResetContext` to the persistence module and `Close` to the read context

**Secondary persistence module changes**

- Improve return values in `Commit` and `Release` (return error, add logging, etc…)
- Add `pgx.Conn` pointer to `PostgresDB`
- `s/db/conn/g` and `s/conn/tx/g` in some (not all) places where appropriate
- Make some exported variables / functions unexported for readability & access purposes
- Add a few helpers for persistence related unit testing
- Added unit tests and TODOs for handling multiple read/write contexts

## [0.0.0.2] - 2022-08-03

Deprecate PrePersistence

- Fix for bytes parameters
- Accounts / pools default to 0
- Pre-added accounts to genesis file
- Separated out Persistence Read Context from Persistence Write Context
- Added various TODO's in order to code-complete a working persistence module
- Added genesis level functions to GetAllActors() and GetAllAccounts/Pools() for testing
- Added PopulateGenesisState function to persistence module
- Fixed the stake status iota issue
- Discovered and documented (with TODO) double setting parameters issue
- Attached to the Utility Module and using in `make compose_and_watch`

## [0.0.0.1] - 2022-07-05

# Added

- Base persistence module implementation for the following actors: `Account`, `Pool`, `Validator`, `Fisherman`, `ServiceNode`, `Application`
- Generalization of common protocol actor behvaiours via the `ProtocolActor` and `BaseActor` interface and implementation
- A PostgreSQL based implementation of the persistence middleware including:
  - SQL query implementation for each actor
  - SQL schema definition for each actor
  - SQL execution for common actor behaviours
  - Golang interface implementation of the Persistence module
- Update to the Persistence module interface to enable historical height queries
- Library / infrastructure for persistence unit fuzz testing
- Tests triggered via `make test_persistence`
